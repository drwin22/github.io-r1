    "text": "Commitment\nCommitment to learning the content, Responsibility for their own learning is also very important. I believe that hard work will produce good results. I want my students to practice and work together to instill deep learning in their minds so they can learn better for themselves. Students have to be actively engaged in the learning process.\nWilliam Butler Yeats said, “Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire.” Students should feel excited about what they are learning so they can feel a sense of inspiration and enjoyment. I want to make sure my class is a joyful learning experience applying theories to practice and dealing with real world situations. Students are also curious to experience different realities than what they used to.\nIn one class who were mostly native speaking English students in the technical areas of welding, carpentry, and machine tool operators, I had to create lessons that were practical and tailored to their own trade areas so they can feel connected to their own trades. I also have a lot of immigrant students who know math well, but have difficulty with English. In this case I paired these students up with native English speakers so they can help each other. This works especially well with word problems which are difficult for everyone.\nWorking together and getting to know one another develops respect for one another. I believe in cooperative learning, where they do group work and projects rather than filling their time with lots of assignments just to keep them busy. ## Community Community supporting one another. Math should be about self-discovery and finding solutions. Math is not just about numbers and formulas. It requires students to do a lot of active reasoning and critical thinking. There are multiple approaches to solving problems. Students need to try all options and figure out which ones are best suited to them. Sometimes they try and fail but, in my class, failure is an option. When students fail, they learn from their mistakes and strive for the best results. This helps them build resiliency and brings them success next time. Learning is a lifelong experience. Nelson Mandela said, “Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.” My students need mathematics so they can go out and do what is necessary for their careers. Through inquiry, students can explore different environments in science and math.\nSometimes we must give up our control and have the students feel free to communicate and come up with a solution their own way. Sometimes we have to be the guide on the side and not the sage on the stage. When students bring in their own ideas, other students will see that there are multiple ways of solving problems. Diversity of ideas and opinions is highly valued in my classes.\nIn conclusion, I sometimes hear students tell me their parents enjoyed being in my class and that is the most rewarding feeling of satisfaction. I feel like I am making an important impact on their lives for multiple generations."

The online class structure more easily accommodated differentiation and a more personalized learning approach.\nFrancois used the flipped classroom model early on. Students would prepare their materials before coming to class and use class time to come together with common questions. This method created a more nurturing and supportive environment where students felt safe to ask questions and learn from each other.\nFor students who were first generation college students, limited English proficient, or coming back to education after a long time, Francois’ classes were a place where students could get to know each other and work in groups so they could feel supported by their peers."

He has worked to promote STEM competitions through a Math Club where one of his students received second place in a national competition. He has also collaborated with outside institutions. He is proud of a Nano Technology project he worked on with some math and chemistry students at the University of Minnesota. This was an opportunity to see nano technology applied in Waver and Microchip research and development. Francois collaborated with the Roseville School District to help develop math syllabi in trade areas so students can prepare for entering college in a trade program.\nFrancois has gone above and beyond teaching math during the summer which may be more convenient for students with non traditional schedules. He taught in the Summer Bridge program helping high school students in the Metro area take math while they explored training programs offered at Saint Paul College. He has worked tirelessly to make education more accessible for minorities and non-traditional students of all kinds."
